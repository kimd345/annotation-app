		text: "Hi Dan- It was great chatting with you this week. We are very interested in continuing the interview process - If you are interested, we'd love to schedule a more technical in-person follow up. Would Tuesday work for you at all by any chance to meet with us in our Midtown office? If yes - please let me know what times you are available. If not, please let me know some alternative dates/times. Also - if you'd like to chat more before committing to an in person meeting, feel free to let me know and we can hop on a call. Thanks again -Igor"
